# Camille's Portfolio
## Purpose
I built this Portfolio with future employers in mind. The portfolio has three sections that tell a little about me, my work, and ways to contact me. Each project box has a link to different projects I have completed and those I will complete in the future. I hope this portfolio highlights my strengths and offers future employers some insight into my skills as a web developer.
